An analysis, that uncovers several insights of the Parliament elections in Czech republic during year 2021. The underlying dataset used for this analysis was acquired from the https://www.czso.cz/ website. The initial motivation of this project was my curiosity to investigate the correlation between the education and number of preference votes of each candidate running for the political office.

Additionally, I have uncovered the comparison between the gender distribution of all running candidates and successfully elected candidates using the population pyramids.
